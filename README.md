# 🌐 HTML & CSS Practice 

This repository contains all my hands-on practice and mini-projects while learning **HTML** and **CSS**. I’ve created separate files and folders for each core concept, tags, selectors, and properties, along with a real-world mini project — a **YouTube clone** built from scratch.

- Media (images, videos, audio)

### ✅ CSS
